# useSafeContext

The hook is just a wrapper around builtin `useContext`
but it throws and error if was rendered not in a defined context.

The hook treats `undefined` value as missed context.
So, make sure your context does not contain `undefined`.
If you need to represent missed value, I would recommend to use `null` instead.

```ts
import useSafeContext from '@boonya/react-utils/hooks/useSafeContext';
```

```ts
function useSafeContext<T>(context: Context<T>): Context<T> | never;
```
